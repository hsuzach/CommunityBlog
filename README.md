## Description
The Community Tech Blog utilizes sequelize, sequelize-sessions, express and handlebars to create a restful API in which users can create an account, share their thoughts in the form of blog posts, as well as leave comments to other users' posts. The app also incorporates [BULMA](https://bulma.io/) to render a mobile-responsiveness design.
